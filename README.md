# Portfolio
A Digital portfolio of all of the development projects I have developed, over the years.
This repository is organized by two main types of projects:
 - School - projets I developed while in High School or College
 - Personal - projects I developed for my own enjoyment

Each project will have their own readme to separately decribe each project, as to prevent this readme from being a novel in length.
